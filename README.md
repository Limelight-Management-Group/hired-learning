### My name is Wayne Banks, and I am full stack software engineer with over 3 years of web development experience. I wanted to spend some time and make sure that I was as prepared as possible for my next role. Being able to code is important, once you get the job. This week was about getting prepared to get hired. 

### Thank you for visiting my repo. This is my attempt to get hired. Seems like it is going well. I'll follow up...
